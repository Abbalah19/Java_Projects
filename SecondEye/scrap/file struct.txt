Here's a step-by-step plan for setting up a new Java project called "Second Eye" with a GUI and an SQLite database:

Create the project directory structure:

SecondEye/
src/
main/
java/
com/
secondeye/
gui/
database/
Main.java
resources/
database/
secondeye.db
lib/
build/
Add necessary dependencies:

SQLite JDBC driver (e.g., sqlite-jdbc-<version>.jar) in the lib/ directory.
Create basic files:

Main.java for the entry point of the application.
GUI classes in the gui/ package.
Database connection and operations in the database/ package.
Pseudocode:
Create directories:

mkdir -p SecondEye/src/main/java/com/secondeye/gui
mkdir -p SecondEye/src/main/java/com/secondeye/database
mkdir -p SecondEye/src/main/resources/database
mkdir -p SecondEye/lib
mkdir -p SecondEye/build
Download SQLite JDBC driver and place it in the lib/ directory.

Create Main.java:

Define the main method.
Initialize the GUI.
Connect to the SQLite database.
